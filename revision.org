* Normal forms

** 1st normal form

- Each cell to be single values
- Entries in a column are same type
- Rows uniquely identified:
  + Add unique ID
  + Or add more columns to make unique

** 2nd normal form

- All attributes (non-key columns) depend on the key.

** 3rd normal form

- All fields (columns) can be determined Only by the Key in the table an no other columns

** 4rd normal form
   
- No multi-valued dependencies

| PRENOM      | Producer's first name            |
| REGION      | Production region                |

This table is in First Normal Form. Let's make it second normal form.
